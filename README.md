This is an standalone NDN simulator with high focus on caching mechanism, written entirely in python.

It is completely based on the NDN-Sim's architecture.

The main credit for developement of this simulator goes to [@RezvanRezaee](https://github.com/RezvanRezaee) 

I was mainly a project/thesis supervisor during her Masters (In HSST-lab @ Sharif University of Technology).
